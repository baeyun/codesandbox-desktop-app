<h1 align="center">Codesandbox Desktop App</h1>

This is a Codesandbox desktop client app that I'm developing. It's experimental for now, but will certainly be made available soon for OSS and production in the official Codesandbox app. See this <a href="https://twitter.com/bukharim96/status/1002768801593688065">tweet</a>.

## How it works

This project wraps Codesandbox in electron and leverage some of its native APIs. This is a working progress. The current state as shown in the above demo video has some bugs that I'm intending to fix in my spare time.

The main aim is to gracefully integrate this desktop port into Codesandbox's repo. I achieve this by only overriding the core functionality as required without having to reinvent the wheel.

I'll be sure to publish more articles and docs describing the inner workings of this project.
